# Writing Prompt Generator

### THE APP'S BACKSTORY:

I love to write and got back into it when COVID hit.  I took some classes thru Community Ed. One of the things that I loved about taking classes was having a teacher to give directives.  Being told what to do, and for how long to do it, allowed me the freedom to just be present and write!  With this project, my goal was to recreate the teacher within the app.

__I sought to gift the user with the freedom to just write by:__
1. Structuring the app so that user immediately logs in and then the writing begins
2. The app randomly chooses a writing prompt for the user
3. Time allotment for each prompt has been pre-determined 

## TECHNOLOGIES USED
__Back-end built using:__ Flask, Python, & SQLAlchemy             
__Front-end built using:__ JavaScript, jQuery, AJAX, Jinja, and Bootstrap

### *Building out the App*       
I have a 3-ring binder full of writing apps from the numerous writing classes I took while in lockdown.  So I would like to build out this application, which of course begs the question of 'How?'.        
              
__Road Map for building out the app:__    
- Thus far, I've given the user autonomy by allowing them to choose their own writing prompt
  - This is done on the homepage, with a drop down menu linking to longer writing prompts
  - Further still, the user can set the timer themselves      
- Next Steps:
  - Determining what code I can potentially clean up and reuse
  - Brainstorming how I might want to link the shorter writing prompts which are intended to be warm-ups with the longer prompts, create a wireframe, and do another 2-week code sprint
