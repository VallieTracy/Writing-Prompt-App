Our Awesome App
===============

AwesomeAppâ„¢ is a disruptive, thought-leading, growth-hacking application for
searching for employees. It's like the Uber of employee-finding apps.

First, let's get the stuff we need for our test::

    >>> import json
    >>> from server import app
    >>> from model import User, Nugget, Word, connect_to_db, db, example_data
    >>> client = app.test_client()

We'll use a temporary database in our tests::

    >>> connect_to_db(app, 'postgresql:///testdb')

We'll put some sample data into it::

    >>> db.create_all()
    >>> example_data()
